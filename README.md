# Java Arcade Projects 🕹️

A collection of classic arcade-style games built using **Java** and the **Swing** library. This repository showcases my journey in game logic, GUI design, and object-oriented programming.

## 🚀 Projects Included

* **[Whac-A-Mole](./WhacAMole)**: A fast-paced reflex game featuring Mario-themed assets.

## 🛠️ How to Run
Each game is a standalone **Gradle** project. To run a game:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the specific game folder (e.g., `cd WhacAMole`).
3. Run `./gradlew run` (or use your favorite IDE).
